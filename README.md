### Workflow Guidelines
 - PR Review: at the end of each day we will meet to review any PRs as a group that are ready for Thomas to review

 - Carousel of swtching: As we stitch partners and front/back, one person will stay while the other three shift and then they will shift next round that way there is always one person comfortable with what next step is needed with the front or back but we still will all eventually switch and work with every part with everyone in the group.

 - 20 min to research blocker, 10-15 with whole group, then pull in Thomas, do not be stuck on a blocker for more than an HOUR!!!

- When starting a new feature, take the time to make sure we are on the right branch, pull upstream to main branch, etc

- Ping group each time we push/pull and start new features

- Post morning scrum meeting, 5-10 min to make sure eveyone is clear on path for the day and to assign feature for the day

- Post lunch 5-10 min scrum

- Morning/Evening show and tell: where each coding group briefly walks through the code they added the previous/current day so that everyone know what all the code is doing and where to find each component.

- Ping group if uncertain about naming to help make sure front and back correlate
